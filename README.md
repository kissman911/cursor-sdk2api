`cursor-sdk2api` turns the published [`@cursor/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cursor/sdk) into Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Chat Completions, and OpenAI Responses APIs. It uses the official Cursor Agent harness, not browser cookies, private transports, or CLI session scraping.

## Highlights

- **Claude Code** via `/v1/messages`: SSE, tools, parallel and multi-round continuation, cache usage, resume, token estimate.
- **Grok Build** via `/v1/responses`: streaming, function tools, continuation, reasoning usage.
- **Codex / Responses clients** via `/v1/responses`: Responses contract, function tools, streaming.
- **OpenAI SDK** via `/v1/chat/completions`: chat, streaming, tools.

- **Claude 1M mode:** when Cursor's live catalog exposes `context=1m`, including on Sonnet 4.6 and Fable 5, the official SDK parameter is forwarded unchanged.
- **Native client tools:** filesystem, shell, web, and network tools stay in Claude Code, Grok, or Codex and run in your local workspace.
- **One tool engine:** all three protocols share the same Cursor SDK run, parallel-tool, continuation, replay, and session coordinator. Ordinary follow-up with a complete transcript reuses one durable Agent and sends only the current user turn.
- **One gateway key, many accounts:** persistent Cursor account pool, model-aware round-robin, stale SDK-auth recovery, pre-semantic account failover, Dashboard quota, web console, and Docker.
- **Cold continuation recovery:** a complete client transcript can rebuild an expired or moved tool turn while replaying already-completed tools locally instead of executing their side effects twice.
- **Runtime profiles:** default `sdk`. Explicit `sand` spends the account's **Grok Bot weekly quota** over a direct `aiserver.v1.InferenceService/Stream` transport (Cursor rejects Sand traffic on the SDK Agent endpoint). It requires the Grok Bot grant. Text, thinking, and client tools work (tools are carried through a prompt protocol and surface as normal `tool_use` / `tool_result` round trips, so Claude Code's Bash/Read/Edit loop runs); images are dropped, and Sand agents are process-resident (a restart cold-rebuilds from the full transcript). No silent fallback between `sdk` and `sand`.
- **Durable runs:** optional SQLite ledger (`RUNTIME_LEDGER_V2=1`) claims one logical request, keeps observing after disconnect, and finalizes one receipt.
- **Responses compact:** `POST /v1/responses/compact` returns one gateway-local `csgw1.` compaction item without a second Cursor Send.

> Cursor-routed Grok does not provide xAI-native `x_search`. Client-owned web and network tools still work as normal function tools.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 22.19 or newer, one gateway key, and at least one Cursor User API Key to import.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sunnyender-org/cursor-sdk2api.git
cd cursor-sdk2api
npm ci
npm run build
AUTH_MODE=managed GATEWAY_ACCESS_KEY='replace-me' node dist/index.js
```

Open [http://localhost:8080/console/](http://localhost:8080/console/), import one or more Cursor accounts, then call every account through the same gateway key:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GATEWAY_ACCESS_KEY"
```

Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

If Cursor needs a proxy, set `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`. The gateway applies them to both SDK data planes. SOCKS and PAC URLs fail closed.

## Client setup

### Claude Code

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="$GATEWAY_ACCESS_KEY"
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6
claude
```

### Grok Build

```toml
[model.cursor]
name = "cursor-sdk2api"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"
api_key = "<gateway-key>"
model = "grok-4.6"
api_backend = "responses"
```

### Codex

```toml
model = "composer-2.5"
model_provider = "cursor-sdk2api"

[model_providers.cursor-sdk2api]
name = "cursor-sdk2api"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
env_key = "GATEWAY_ACCESS_KEY"
```

Responses clients that require `previous_response_id`, stored response objects, or hosted OpenAI tools are not supported yet.

## Tools and search

Client tools are converted to SDK `local.customTools` through MCP. The model chooses tools through Cursor's harness, while the outer client executes them in its own workspace.

- Supported: Claude Code, Grok, and Codex local tools, including client-owned web or network search.
- Disabled: Cursor ambient shell, read, edit, and task. Hosted `webSearch` /
  `webFetch` stay off unless `HOSTED_SEARCH_MODE=auto` and the client sends a
  bare live web_search tool. Filters, required/named choice, Chat
  `web_search_options`, and `x_search` stay fail closed.
- Not available on this route: xAI `x_search`.
- Not implemented: OpenAI `file_search` and `computer`. Hosted `web_search`
  is opt-in via `HOSTED_SEARCH_MODE=auto`.

## Operations

- `/console/`: local operator console
- `/v1/models`: live Cursor model catalog
- `/v1/account`: pooled Cursor identities and current Dashboard usage in managed mode
- `/health`: capabilities, SDK version, default/sdk/sand profile readiness, and proxy transport mode
- `STATE_DIR`: account, SDK store, and resume state

Managed mode follows CPA's split between client keys and upstream credentials: clients receive only `GATEWAY_ACCESS_KEY`; imported Cursor keys stay in the gateway account store. New sessions use model-aware round-robin. Continuations stay pinned when the original account is healthy; before semantic output, one alternate managed account may be tried. If the original account/session is gone, an exact full transcript can cold-branch safely. BYOK remains available for a trusted single-user sidecar.

Accounts that run out of quota rest automatically: a quota-exhausted failure (Grok Bot weekly limit, Cursor usage limit) records a persisted cooldown until the reset time Cursor reports (or `ACCOUNT_QUOTA_COOLDOWN_MS`, default 1h), and the pool stops handing that account to new sessions until then. Operators can also switch an account off and on from the Console or with `PUT /v0/management/accounts/enabled {"id","enabled"}`; enabling clears any cooldown. When every enabled account is resting, clients receive one `429 rate_limited` that names the earliest reset.

`v0.1` is a trusted single-process sidecar. The management account endpoint has no separate authentication. Imported Cursor keys are stored in owner-only state files and are never returned to the browser after import. The supplied compose files bind the console to loopback; authenticate and restrict `/console/` plus `/v0/management/*` at any Internet-facing proxy.

## Verification

The deterministic suite contains 189 tests. The latest redacted receipt proves persisted and full-transcript recovery on Sonnet 4.6 and Grok 4.6 xhigh: [recovery live smoke](docs/evidence/2026-08-19-beefapi-sync-live-smoke.md). The earlier four-model receipt also covers Fable 5 and Composer 2.5: [four-model evidence](docs/evidence/2026-08-15-live-smoke.md).

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```
